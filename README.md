DATA 512 Final project

# Proposal
In this project I aim to find relationship between the Crime data and COVID19 cases in Seattle. 
The Jupyter notebook in the repository contains the details about the project - motivation, datasets, research questions. 
I will be doing an initial EDA and then work on the hypothesis.
